      Neanderthals also Neandertals, Homo neanderthalensis or Homo sapiens neanderthalensis) are
      an extinct species or subspecies of archaic humans who lived in Eurasia until about 40,000 years ago.They most 
      likely went extinct due to assimilation into the modern human genome (bred into extinction), great climatic change,
      disease, or a combination of these factors.

      It is unclear when the line of Neanderthals split from that of modern humans; studies have produced various intervals ranging from 
      315,000 to more than 800,000 years ago. The time of divergence of Neanderthals from their ancestor H. heidelbergensis is
      also unclear. The oldest potential Neanderthal bones date to 430,000 years ago, but the classification remains uncertain.
      Neanderthals are known from numerous fossils, especially from after 130,000 years ago. The type specimen, Neanderthal 1, was
      found in 1856 in the Neander Valley in present-day Germany. For much of the early 20th Century, researchers depicted Neanderthals 
      as primitive, unintelligent, and brutish. Although knowledge and perception of them has markedly changed since then in the scientific
      community, the image of the unevolved caveman archetype remains prevalent in popular culture.

      Neanderthal technology was quite sophisticated. It includes the Mousterian stone-tool industry and the ability to create 
      fire and build cave hearths, make the adhesive birch bark tar,craft at least simple clothes similar to
      blankets and ponchos, weave, go seafaring through the Mediterranean,make use of medicinal plants,
      as well as treat severe injuries, store food, and use various cooking techniques such as roasting, boiling,
      and smoking. Neanderthals made use of a wide array of food, mainly hoofed mammals, but also other megafauna, plants
      , small mammals, birds, and aquatic and marine resources. Although they were probably apex predators, they still 
      competed with cave bears, cave lions, cave hyaenas, and other large predators. A number of examples of symbolic thought and Palaeolithic art have been inconclusively
      attributed to Neanderthals, namely possible ornaments made from bird bones or shells, collections of unusual objects including crystals and fossils, engravings, music
      production indicated by the Divje Babe Flute, and Spanish cave-paintings contentiously dated to before 65,000 years ago. Some claims of religious beliefs have
      been made. Neanderthals were likely capable of speech, possibly articulate, although the complexity of their language is not known.

      Compared with modern humans, Neanderthals had a more robust build and proportionally shorter limbs. Researchers often explain
      these features as adaptations to conserve heat in a cold climate, but they may also have been adaptations for sprinting 
      in the warmer, forested landscape that Neanderthals often inhabited. Nonetheless, they had cold-specific adaptations, 
      such as specialised body-fat storage and an enlarged nose to warm air (although the nose could have been caused by
      genetic drift). Average Neanderthal men stood around 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) and women 153 cm (5.02 ft) tall, similar to
      pre-industrial modern humans. The braincases of Neanderthal men and women averaged about 1,600 cm3 (98 cu in) and 1,300 cm3
      (79 cu in) respectively, which is within the range of the values for modern humans.
