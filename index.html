      The origin of modern humans has probably been the most debated issue in evolutionary biology over the last few decades.Our evolutionary 
      history is written into our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome" target="_blank">genome</a>.The human genome looks the way it does because of all the genetic changes that have affected our
      ancestors.The exact origin of modern humans has long been a topic debate.Modern humans(Homo sapiens),the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" target="_blank">species</a> that we are,means
      'wise man' in Latin.Our species is the only surviving species of the genus Homo but where we came from has been a topic of much debate.
      Modern humans originated in Africa within the past 200,000 years and evolved from their most likely recent common ancestor,Homo erectus,
      which means 'upright man' in Latin.
    </p>  
    <p>
      Historically,two key models have been put forward to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" target="_blank">evolution</a> of Homo sapiens.These are the 'out of Africa' model and the
      'multi-regional' model.The 'out of Africa' model is currently the most widely accepted model.It proposes that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa 
      before migrating across the world.On the other hand, the 'multi-regional' model proposes that the evolution of Homo sapiens took place in a 
      number of places over a long period of time.The intermingling of the various populations eventually led to the single Homo sapiens species 
      we see today.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is still very much an area of active research,however,current genomic evidence supports a single'out-of Africa' migrations of 
      modern humans rather than the 'multi-regional' model.Although,studies of the genomes of the extinct hominids Neanderthals and Denisovans
      suggest that there was some mixing of genomes(1-3 percent) with humans in Europe and Asia.This is interbreeding between two previously 
      separated populations is called 'admixture' and results in a mixing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" target="_blank">genes</a> between the populations.
