    <h1> Evolution Of Modern Humans </h1>

    <p>
      The origin of modern humans has probably been the most debated issue in evolutionary biology over the last few decades.Our evolutionary 
      history is written into our genome.The human genome looks the way it does because of all the genetic changes that have affected our
      ancestors.The exact origin of modern humans has long been a topic debate.Modern humans(Homo sapiens),the species that we are,means
      'wise man' in Latin.Our species is the only surviving species of the genus Homo but where we came from has been a topic of much debate.
      Modern humans originated in Africa within the past 200,000 years and evolved from their most likely recent common ancestor,Homo erectus,
      which means 'upright man' in Latin.

      Historically,two key models have been put forward to explain the evolution of Homo sapiens.These are the 'out of Africa' model and the
      'multi-regional' model.The 'out of Africa' model is currently the most widely accepted model.It proposes that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa 
      before migrating across the world.On the other hand, the 'multi-regional' model proposes that the evolution of Homo sapiens took place in a 
      number of places over a long period of time.The intermingling of the various populations eventually led to the single Homo sapiens species 
      we see today.

      This is still very much an area of active research,however,current genomic evidence supports a single'out-of Africa' migrations of 
      modern humans rather than the 'multi-regional' model.Although,studies of the genomes of the extinct hominids Neanderthals and Denisovans
      suggest that there was some mixing of genomes(1-3 percent) with humans in Europe and Asia.This is interbreeding between two previously 
      separated populations is called 'admixture' and results in a mixing of genes between the populations.
