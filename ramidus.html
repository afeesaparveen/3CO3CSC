      Ardipithecus ramidus is a species of australopithecine from the Afar region of Early Pliocene Ethiopia 4.4 million years ago. A. ramidus , unlike modern hominids,
      has adaptations for both walking on two legs (bipedality) and life in the trees (arboreality). However, it would not have been as efficient at bipedality as humans, 
      nor at arboreality as non-human great apes. Its discovery, along with Miocene apes, has reworked academic understanding of the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor from
      appearing much like modern day chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas to being a creature without a modern anatomical cognate.

      The facial anatomy suggests that A. ramidus males were less aggressive than those of modern chimps, which is correlated to increased parental care and monogamy in primates.
      It has also been suggested that it was among the earliest of human ancestors to use some proto-language, possibly capable of vocalizing at the same level as a human infant.
      A. ramidus appears to have inhabited woodland and bushland corridors between savannas, and was a generalized omnivore.
