    <h1> Homo Sapiens</h1>

      Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most abundant and widespread species of primate, characterized by bipedalism and large, complex brains. This has enabled the
      development of advanced tools, culture, and language. Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and
      competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, 
      social norms, and rituals, which bolster human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and 
      manipulate phenomena have motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other fields of study.

      Although some scientists equate humans with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage, it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. H. sapiens 
      emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing local populations of archaic 
      humans. For most of history, all humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago, saw
      the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement. As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between 
      communities and a number of civilizations have risen and fallen. Humans have continued to expand, with a global population of over 7.9 billion in December 
      2021.

      Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size and
      life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), two humans are over 99% genetically similar. Humans are
      sexually dimorphic: Generally, men have greater body strength and women have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sex 
      characteristics. Women are capable of pregnancy, and undergo menopause and become infertile at around the age of 50.

      Humans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food 
      since the time of H. erectus. They can survive for up to eight weeks without food, and three or four days without water. Humans are generally diurnal, 
      sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father 
      provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.

      Humans have a large and highly developed prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. They are intelligent, capable of episodic 
      memory, have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness and a theory of mind. The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination,
      volition and forming views on existence. This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development possible through reason and the
      transmission of knowledge to future generations. Language, art and trade are defining characteristics of humans. Long-distance trade routes might have led 
      to cultural explosions and resource distribution that gave humans an advantage over other similar species
