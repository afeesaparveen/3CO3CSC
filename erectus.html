    <h1> Homo Erectus </h2>

      Homo erectus (meaning "upright man") is an extinct species of archaic human from the Pleistocene, with its earliest occurrence
      about 2 million years ago,[2] and its specimens are among the first recognizable members of the genus Homo. H. erectus was the
      first human ancestor to spread throughout Eurasia, with a continental range extending from the Iberian Peninsula to Java. African
      populations of H. erectus are likely to be the ancestors to several human species, such as H. heidelbergensis and H. antecessor, 
      with the former generally considered to have been the ancestor to Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern humans.[3][4][5] Asian 
      populations of H. erectus may be ancestral to H. floresiensis[6] and possibly to H. luzonensis.[7] As a chronospecies, the time 
      of the disappearance of H. erectus is a matter of contention. There are also several proposed subspecies with varying levels of 
      recognition. The last known population of H. erectus is H. e. soloensis from Java, around 117,000–108,000 years ago.[1]

      H. erectus had a humanlike[clarification needed] gait and body proportions, and was the first human species to have exhibited a flat face, 
      prominent nose, and possibly sparse body hair coverage. Though brain size certainly exceeds that of ancestor species, capacity varied
      widely depending on the population. In older populations, brain development seemed to cease early in childhood, suggesting that 
      offspring were largely self-sufficient at birth, thus limiting cognitive development through life. Nonetheless, sites generally 
      show consumption of medium to large animals, such as bovines or elephants, and suggest the development of predatory behaviour and 
      coordinated hunting. H. erectus is associated with the Acheulean stone tool industry, and is postulated to have been the earliest 
      human ancestor capable of using fire, hunting and gathering in coordinated groups, caring for injured or sick group members, and
      possibly seafaring and art (though examples of art are controversial, and are otherwise rudimentary and few and far between).

      H. erectus men and women may have been roughly the same size as each other (i.e. exhibited reduced sexual dimorphism) like modern humans,
      which could indicate monogamy in line with general trends exhibited in primates. Size, nonetheless, ranged widely from 146–185 cm 
      (4 ft 9 in–6 ft 1 in) in height and 40–68 kg (88–150 lb) in weight. It is unclear if H. erectus was anatomically capable of speech, 
      though it is postulated they communicated using some proto-language.
